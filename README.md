# Health & Safety

## Inspiration
Health & Safety was born from the desire to make everyday safety and wellbeing accessible to everyone. We saw how stress, lack of preparation, and emergency confusion can cause real harm ‚Äî so we built a simple, practical web tool that teaches, monitors, and helps in critical moments.

## What it does
Health & Safety is a web application that:
- Shows nearby hospitals on a live map (real-time location).
- Simulates and displays vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, stress level).
- Offers first-aid guidance and short stress-relief exercises.
- Provides an AI chatbot for quick advice on emergencies, first-aid steps, and wellness tips.
- Includes hydration tracking and medication reminders.
- Lets users schedule and track health events (calendar/medication reminders).
- Contains an emergency button that triggers an audible alert and notifies contacts.

## Key features
- **Interactive map** with OpenStreetMap + Overpass API to find hospitals.
- **Real-time location tracking** using browser geolocation.
- **Simulated vital signs** and quick-check buttons for high/low pressure, heart rate, and stress.
- **Hydration tracker** ‚Äî mark water intake as completed.
- **Medication calendar** with local storage and push notification reminders.
- **AI Health Assistant** (embed or API) to answer health & safety questions.
- **Emergency alarm** and quick call links for medical contacts.

## How we built it
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (modern responsive design), JavaScript, Leaflet (maps).
- **APIs / Tools:** OpenStreetMap tiles + Overpass API, Browser Geolocation, Web Notifications API.
- **Chatbot:** Hugging Face Space embed or any LLM endpoint (optional integration).
- **Persistence:** LocalStorage for user reminders and calendar entries.
- **Optional Backend:** small Node/Flask service if you want to proxy or secure AI keys.

## Challenges we ran into
- Making the UI calming, clear and accessible under stress.
- Handling geolocation permissions and varying browser support.
- Ensuring notifications and reminders behave consistently on mobile and desktop.
- Balancing simulated vitals (for demos) vs. real device integrations (future work).

## What we learned
- Design for clarity: in emergencies users need direct actions and minimal friction.
- Local notifications + calendar reminders improve adherence to medication and hydration routines.
- Small, well-scoped AI assistance (first-aid guidance, calming instructions) adds huge user value when carefully crafted.

## Accomplishments
- Functional prototype with live map and hospital lookup.
- Interactive medication calendar with local reminders and notifications.
- AI chatbot integrated (embeddable) to provide on-demand guidance.
- Modern, responsive UI suitable for mobile users.

## What‚Äôs next
- Multilingual support.
- Real device integration (Bluetooth health sensors / wearables).
- Server-side options for secure AI keys and telemetry (consent-first).
- Partnerships with local health providers and NGOs for deployment.

## How to use (quick)
1. Open the web app in a modern browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox recommended).  
2. Allow location access so the map can show your position and nearby hospitals.  
3. Check your vitals panel and press the quick-check buttons to evaluate your status.  
4. Use the hydration button whenever you drink water ‚Äî the app will mark it completed.  
5. Add medications or health reminders to the calendar; allow notifications so alerts arrive on time.  
6. If you feel unsafe or in an emergency, press the emergency button to sound the alarm and access quick-call options.  
7. Use the embedded AI Health Assistant to ask about first aid, stress relief exercises, or what to do next.
